Welcome!

You need Linqpad for this stuff.
Get it: http://www.linqpad.net/download.aspx
It's free but more features can be paid for, but you don't need the extra features to run these code samples.

Install it and open the .LINQ files that you are interested in.

Read the code and see how it works!

Voila! You are now enlightened.
